# API Documentation
## LionWheel enables developers and publishers to easily and efficiently interface through the API!

What is an API? An interface designed to connect different systems.

Our API is very easy to use and allows external software to connect and create deliveries automatically.

This technical documentation is intended for developers who want to create tasks and interact with [LionWheel](https://www.lionwheel.com).

**For any questions or problems you can contact help at support@lionwheel.com**

## Introduction

* All interface calls are in the https protocol.
* The body of all requests and responses are json format.
* The dates are in dd/mm/yyyy format.
* All interface calls are authenticated with that will is used to identify and associate the request to the correct customer.

It is important to note that there are two types of calls (with two different types of tokens):
Interface of the shipping company - will be used by the shipping company to create deliveries for their customers.
Token - of the shipping company. The customer must indicate the shipping affiliation (company_id) in the request body
Customer interface of the shipping company - will be used by the customer to create deliveries (the delivery will be automatically associated with the customer and the shipping company).

## Authentication

In all requests the token must be passed in a query parameter named key, for example:

```
https://members.lionwheel.com/api/v1/tasks/create?key=my_cool_token
```

How do I know which token I should use?

As mentioned, there are two types of tokens:
Shipping Company - The token is in the settings under the API definition - KEY API key.
In addition to the token, it is mandatory to request the customer ID to which the shipment will be associated. The customer ID is at the top of the customer settings page.
Customer of a delivery company - ask for the token from the shipping company.
The shipping company will bring the ID from the customer definition page under the API key.
It is important to note and make sure that a token of this type starts with c_key.
